# Portfolio-architect-sophie-bluel

This is a project of an architect portfolio website.
It has a regular view containing the architect profile, gallery with her works and a contact form.
It also has a link to a login page, when the architect can log in and have access as an administrator (edition mode), where she can delete, as well as add new works to the backend and have the UI updated accordingly. 

 - Information on how to launch the server side is in the Backend folder, on its README file.
